					<h1>Why did you choose to study CSE?</h1>
					<p>
					It's a long story I will try to cover in short lines.
					<br>In my college the branch selection is offered only after engineering 1st year and completely based on engineering 1st year marks and reservation.I have sufficient marks to get any department in my college, but I chosen CSE as career because if I study other than CSE I have to depend on some other persons, have to wait for offers from companies, number of subjects have to be preloaded in my mind and continues reading is required.
					<br>At that time I took the opinions from my seniors, friends relatives, my relatives. Most of them said either CSE, ECE, Civil. In above three I like CSE and civil only, because by taking ECE I don't want to become bookworm.
					<br>
					<br>Civil : In my college we don't have sufficient staff for this branch ,at that time government also not good because civil guys mostly get government or PSU jobs.
					<br>CSE : In my department staff is good and sufficient. The department which only have practical labs is CSE. In CSE for every lab you will get practical experience. after graduation you can do whatever you want.
					<br>
					<br>Last and final word is “Till now I am not hesitated my branch and studies”. And these are the reasons why I took CSE only. The answer is completely my opinion, I hope you don't take it as personal.
